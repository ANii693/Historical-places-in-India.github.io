# First website - Historical places in india
Hello ,


This repo shows my first website project - [MYFIRSTWEBPG](https://anii693.github.io/Historical-places-in-India.github.io/)


web page on historical places in India


Webpage Includes Images of historical places and brief description of that Images


The Web Page is also Responsive Using *css grid box* concept


Had learnt these concepts on the go that's why you may find weird lines in the html and surely it could be optimized(better presented)



Learner.
